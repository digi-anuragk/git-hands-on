## What is Git
Git is a distributed version control system, (VCS). Instead of the traditional centralized control system where even checking out a file required admin privileges, git allows any work to be locally and may diverge as much as you want.

## Goal
To know git well. Not all the commands, but enough that you git it. We will target `99%`. We will primarily use the high level commands, but will dip down into the low level commands to really understand how git works.

:::tip[Fact]

`Git` and `GitHub` are 2 differnt things. `Git` is the actual tool which provide us all the functionality, cli commands, etc..., whereas `GitHub` is just a server whose sole purpose is to backup our repo, into a server.
